This is a python module to help us to do the tranformations between raw file, csv file, and numpy array.

* numpy>=1.22
* pandas>=1.4

you can download those module for the latest version with the command below

```shell

handsomeguy@supercomputer:~$ pip install numpy
handsomeguy@supercomputer:~$ pip install pandas

+-- yourpythonfile.py
|
+--src/
   +--catimage.raw
   +--dogimage.csv
|
+--output/
|
```
```python
# @yourpythonfile.py

import ImgToolBox.ImgFile as ITB

# you should put the path of raw file in the raw2arr fumction and you will get the numpy array from raw file
array = ITB.raw2arr('src/catimage.raw')

# now you can get the numpy array from the path of csv file
new_array = ITB.csv2arr('src/dogimage.csv')

# aftere doing this, you could get the csv file in the path you want
ITB.arr2csv(new_array, 'output/dogimage.csv')
