# Image Tool Box

This is a python module to help us to do the tranformations between raw file, csv file, and numpy array.

## Requirements
It would be better if you got those version number bigger than these below
* python >= 3.9
* numpy >= 1.22
* pandas >= 1.4
* matplotlib >= 3.4.3
  
you can download those module for the latest version with the command below

```shell
handsomeguy@supercomputer:~$ pip install ImgToolBox
handsomeguy@supercomputer:~$ pip install numpy
handsomeguy@supercomputer:~$ pip install pandas
handsomeguy@supercomputer:~$ pip install matplotlib
```
## Usage example
your structure could probably look like this below

```
.
+-- yourpythonfile.py
|
+--src/
   +--catimage.raw
   +--dogimage.csv
|
+--output/
|
```
```python
# @yourpythonfile.py

import ImgToolBox.ImgFile as ITB

# you should put the path of raw file in the raw2arr fumction and you will get the numpy array from raw file
array = ITB.toArray('src/catimage.raw', (300, 800), dtype = '>u2')

# you can get the numpy array from the path of csv file
new_array = ITB.toArray('src/dogimage.csv')

# aftere doing this, you could get the csv file in the path you want
ITB.arr2csv(new_array, 'output/dogimage.csv')

# you can create a frame difference image by doing this
arr1 = np.array([50, 50, 50]).astype(np.uint8)
arr2 = np.array([10, 40, 90]).astype(np.uint8)
arr3 = ITB.imageDiff(arr1, arr2, 10)
# arr3 = [255   0 255]

# you can easily transform image array to histogram
ITB.saveHist(array, 'myHistogram.png', bins = 1024, title = "arr", xlim=(0, 1024), ylim=(0, 10000))
```
